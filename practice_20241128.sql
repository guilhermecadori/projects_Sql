    You are given a table named repositories, format as below:

    ** repositories table schema **
        project
        commits
        contributors
        address

    The table shows project names of major cryptocurrencies, their numbers of commits 
    and contributors and also a random donation address ( not linked in any way :) ).

    Your job is to split out the letters and numbers from the address provided, 
    and return a table in the following format:

    ** output table schema **
        project
        letters
        numbers

    Case should be maintained.

SELECT project,
       regexp_replace(address, '[^A-Za-z]', '', 'g') AS letters,
       regexp_replace(address, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS numbers
